        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Creole Seasoning</li>

        <li>
          Coat the chicken breasts with olive oil, then sprinkle both sides with
          salt and Creole seasoning.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place the seasoned chicken in a broiler pan. Bake in an oven for about
          10 minutes, then flip and continue to bake for about 15 more minutes
          (or until the juices run clear). When the chicken is done baking,
          transfer it to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour the chicken broth into the pan you used to bake the chicken.
          Scrape any browned bits off the side with a spatula. Drizzle the pan
          sauce over the baked chicken before serving.
